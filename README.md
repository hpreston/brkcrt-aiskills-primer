# AI Skills Primer for CCNP Candidates

> **Note:** This documentation was generated with the assistance of Generative AI.

A collection of hands-on examples and demonstrations designed to help network engineers preparing for CCNP-level certifications explore AI capabilities for network automation. These examples align with CCNP Automation blueprint topics and provide practical learning experiences with modern AI tools and frameworks.

## üéØ Project Overview

This repository contains practical examples that demonstrate key AI and automation concepts relevant to network engineering professionals. The examples are designed as educational material for a presentation called "AI Skills Primer for CCNP Candidates" and focus on two core areas from the CCNP Automation blueprints:

1. **Construct an MCP server to provide network information to an AI-agent using Python FastMCP**
2. **Construct a conversational agent that leverages LLMs for network automation**

Each example is self-contained with its own documentation, dependencies, and learning objectives, making it easy to explore individual concepts or work through the complete learning path.

## üìö Examples

### ü§ñ [Conversational Agent](./conversational_agent/)

**Learning Focus:** Building AI-powered conversational interfaces for network automation

A comprehensive example demonstrating how to create a conversational AI agent using LangChain and local language models. This example showcases fundamental patterns for building chatbot interfaces that can be extended for network automation tasks.

**Key Technologies:**
- LangChain for LLM orchestration
- LangGraph for stateful conversations
- Ollama for local model hosting
- Rich for enhanced CLI interfaces

**CCNP Relevance:** Understanding how to create user-friendly interfaces for automation tools and integrate conversational AI into network operations workflows.

### üîß [MCP pyATS Network Automation Tool](./mcp-pyats/)

**Learning Focus:** Creating Model Context Protocol servers for AI-powered network device interaction

A practical implementation of an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates Cisco's pyATS framework to provide AI agents with network device automation capabilities. This example demonstrates how to expose network automation functions as AI-accessible tools.

**Key Technologies:**
- FastMCP for Model Context Protocol implementation
- pyATS/Genie for network device automation
- Structured command parsing and data extraction
- Multi-vendor device support

**CCNP Relevance:** Direct application of programmatic device interaction, API integration patterns, and modern automation frameworks aligned with CCNP Automation objectives.
